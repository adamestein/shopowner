---------

commission_factor   = commission factor
discount            = discount to apply to price of item
discount_factor     = discount factor
list_price          = price an item is listed to sell for
sales_tax_price     = what item sold for which includes sales tax
tax_rate            = tax rate factor

percent_commission  = commission in percent
percent_discount    = discount in percent
percent_tax_rate    = tax rate in percent

Equations
---------
commission          = list_price*commission_factor
commission_factor   = percent_commission/100
discount            = list_price*discount_factor
discount_factor     = percent_discount/100
list_price          = taxable_price/(1 - discount_factor)
tax_rate            = percent_tax_rate/100
taxable_price       = sales_tax_price/(1 + tax_rate) = list_price - discount
sales_tax_price     = taxable_price*(1 + tax_rate) = taxable_price + (taxable_price*tax_rate)
